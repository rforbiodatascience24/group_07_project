# Introduction

Evolution can be explained by developmental timing differences, with neoteny proposed as a mechanism contributing to cognitive traits. 
The study analyzes gene expression during postnatal brain development in humans, chimpanzees, and macaques to explore neotenic shifts.

**Biological Insight**:
- Human prefrontal cortex development shows delayed gene expression, influencing neural plasticity.

**Objective**:
- Analyze datasets using PCA, regression, and heterochrony tests to reveal insights into gene expression shifts.

## Materials and Methods

### Data Overview
- **Source**: Somel et al. (2009), GEO datasets (GSE11528, GSE11512, GSE15163).
- **Samples**:
  - Humans: 39 (0–47 years).
  - Chimpanzees: 14 (0–44 years).
  - Macaques: 9 (1–18 years).

**Pipeline**:
1. Data cleaning and augmentation.
2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
3. Regression models for age and species effects.
4. Heterochrony tests to detect timing shifts.

## Data Cleaning and Augmentation

### Step 1: Data Cleaning
- Addressed missing values and inconsistencies.
- Verified dataset structure and variables.

### Step 2: Augmentation
- Merged datasets across species.
- Derived variables for age and expression scaling.

## PCA and Explained Variance

### Principal Component Analysis
- Identified major sources of expression variance.
- **Key Result**:
  - PCA separated species along Components 1 and 2.
