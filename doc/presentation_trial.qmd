# Introduction

Evolution can be explained by developmental timing differences, with neoteny proposed as a mechanism contributing to cognitive traits. 
The study analyzes gene expression during postnatal brain development in humans, chimpanzees, and macaques to explore neotenic shifts.

**Biological Insight**:
- Human prefrontal cortex development shows delayed gene expression, influencing neural plasticity.

**Objective**:
- Analyze datasets using PCA, regression, and heterochrony tests to reveal insights into gene expression shifts.

## Materials and Methods

### Data Overview

- **Source**: Somel et al. (2009), GEO accession numbers: GSE11528, GSE11512, GSE15163.
- **Samples**:
  - 39 humans (0–47 years).
  - 14 chimpanzees (0–44 years).
  - 9 rhesus macaques (1–18 years).

**Pipeline**:
1. Data loading and cleaning.
2. PCA to identify major expression patterns.
3. Regression analyses to test age and species effects.
4. Heterochrony tests to detect timing shifts.
