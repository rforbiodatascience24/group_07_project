# To do, all
- Add yourself at the top of this doc
- Check that all code commited follows https://r4bds.github.io/code_styling.htmlllows
- Provide all scripts in .qmd visual format - remember to add comments to sections
- Ensure all scripts are organized according to "Organisation" in https://r4bds.github.io/project_description.html
- Create a branch to work in, and only merge to main once code has been properly edited

# To do, to be divided - maybe into different analyses?
- Augment data, extract relevant attributes (there are two separate tibbles to do this on)
- Augment data, format attribute names and values (there are two separate tibbles to do this on)
- Augment data, join data into one tibble
- Augment data, nest tibble nest to prepare for analysis
- Augment data, add relevant variables for anlysis (e.g. age, brain section)
- Analyse data, add calculated variables (e.g. differential gene expression, age groups)
- Augment data, unnest tibble to prepare for visualization
- Visualize data, create plots, consider patchwork and The glamout of graphics (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5cTacaWE6I)

Currently the data are loaded and cleaned using the libraries "GEOquery" and "Biobase". We should consider looking into making our own script, based on Biobase.
