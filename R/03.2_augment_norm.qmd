# Normalization of Age

A new dataframe named normalized_joined will be created. Normalized age values will be added to a new column named normalized_age, moved to the front of the dataframe, and rounded to 4 decimal places. Age for all species will be normalized based on average life expectancy from birth found online from the following sources.

-   human: 26061 days (as of 2021) from [WHO](https://data.who.int/indicators/i/90E2E48)

-   chimpanzee : 12008.5 days from [Research Paper](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8364750/)

-   macaque: 5475 days from [The Macaque Website](https://macaques.nc3rs.org.uk/about-macaques/life-history)

```{r}
normalized_joined <- pheno_expr_data_joined |>
  mutate(normalized_age = case_when(
    species == "Human" ~ round(age / 26061, 4),
    species == "Chimpanzee" ~ round(age / 12008.5, 4),
    species == "Macaque" ~ round(age / 5475, 4)
  )) |>
  select(normalized_age, everything(), -age)
```
